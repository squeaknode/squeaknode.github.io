&lt;p&gt;This guide will go over some of the things you can do with the app&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;set-up-a-signing-profile&quot;&gt;Set up a signing profile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you might want to do is create a signing profile. This profile allows you to create squeaks, and it will be your identity that other users will see attached to your squeaks. You can create as many signing profiles as you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to the profiles page&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click the “Create Signing Profile” button&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enter any name that you want for your profile and submit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/4dcbe92e41f407b37d5b3b850d0132ecbd2a2846.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot from 2021-11-11 04-15-20&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;make-a-squeak&quot;&gt;Make a squeak&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you have a signing profile, you can now make a squeak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to the timeline page&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click on the button in the bottom right corner to open the “Make Squeak” dialog&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select the signing profile from the form selection&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enter any text (and emojis) that you want, up to 280 characters and submit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/e8f76e492d36a8313a7a5734c7ad25214075a0d9.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot from 2021-11-11 04-17-41&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;connect-to-other-nodes&quot;&gt;Connect to other nodes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you have created some squeaks, you may be wondering if anyone else can read them. Other users will only be able to download your squeaks if their node is connected to your node (or if they connect to another node that already has copies of your squeaks).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can establish connections to other nodes in two ways:
1) open a connection to another node using its external address
2) share your node’s external address and let other nodes connect to you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a connection is established, it doesn’t matter which node started the connection, inbound and outbound connections are treated the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;make-an-outbound-connection&quot;&gt;Make an outbound connection&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know the external address of another squeaknode, you can connect to it directly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to the “Peers” page&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click on the “Connect Peer” button&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enter the external address host in the input form&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enter the external address port in the input form, if it is anything other than the default (8555)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check the “Use Tor” toggle if the address is an onion address&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Submit the dialog form&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few seconds, if the connection is successful, you should see the newly connected peer in the list of connected peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/268bc4e9f8e10d26e1f6d2516c3d349b256eddfb.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot from 2021-11-11 04-24-52&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;accept-inbound-connections&quot;&gt;Accept inbound connections&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also share your external address, and allow other nodes to make connections to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to the “Peers” page&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click on the “Show External Address” button&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Copy the content of the displayed address and share it wherever you want&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now anyone who knows this external address can use it to make a connection from their squeaknode to yours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/6f3fa0563c88917bf4f48522225893e5c1135030.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot from 2021-11-11 04-31-09&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;download-squeaks-from-other-users&quot;&gt;Download Squeaks from other users&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have some peer connections open, you can begin to download squeaks from other users onto your timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The squeaknode timeline only shows squeaks from profiles that you are following. You can begin to follow profiles by adding contacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask a friend (who is running squeaknode) to share with you the address of their signing profile&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to the “Profiles” page&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click on the “Add Contact” button&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enter the name of the person&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enter the address that was provided&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Submit the form to create the new contact profile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/b02a93fb2c516c043f645f72ed87ef44fb445a5a.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot from 2021-11-11 04-43-20&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the contact profile is created, your squeaknode will begin to download squeaks from all of your connected peers that match were authored by that profile. If you go to the “Timeline” page, you should see the squeaks in the timeline, if any were downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;buying-squeaks&quot;&gt;Buying squeaks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you have some squeaks from other users visible in your timeline, but they are locked, so you can’t read them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2e1de521f24d4e60a43bb273ffd7242c02169979.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot from 2021-11-11 04-49-13&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You unlock squeaks by making Lightning payments to the peers that are selling them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click on the squeak that you want to unlock&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click on the “Buy To Unlock” button in the middle of the squeak&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When the dialog opens, select one of the offers from the selection&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check the price of the squeak, and if you agree to pay that amount, click the “Buy Squeak” button&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wait a few seconds for the Lightning payment to complete, and then the squeak should unlock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/e9b0aa6079af9788e680dcd94939feec837b1ef3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot from 2021-11-11 04-52-34&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you should see the unlocked content of the squeak&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/148406198d39ba350074c2d64837e7a22c8bef66.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot from 2021-11-11 04-54-57&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;opening-a-lightning-channel-directly-to-a-seller&quot;&gt;Opening a Lightning channel directly to a seller&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the lightning payment will fail. This usually happens because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You do not have a route to the payee&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You do not have enough liquidity in your route&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to open a Lightning channel directly to the seller node, you can do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click on the “Buy To Unlock” button in the middle of the squeak&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When the dialog opens, select one of the offers from the selection&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click on the link on the “Lightning Node” section of the offer display to go to the “Lightning Node” page&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click on the “Connect Peer” button to ensure that your Lightning node is connected to the seller Lightning node.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click on the “Open Channel” button to open the “Open Channel” dialog&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enter whatever amount you want to fund the channel and for the transaction fee and submit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now wait for the Bitcoin transactions to complete for the channel to finish opening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/5b19df1dcf5047cbce2e12dc44b05b9c35d6d932.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot from 2021-11-11 05-05-10&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the channel finishes opening, you should be able to complete the payment without any problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;connect-your-twitter-account&quot;&gt;Connect your Twitter account&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a Twitter user, you can mirror your tweets automatically to your squeaknode profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Obtain a “bearer token” from Twitter (you have to create a Twitter developer account: https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to the “Twitter” page in the squeaknode app&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click the “Set Bearer Token” button and copy the bearer token from your Twitter Developer account&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click the “Add Twitter Account” button and enter your Twitter handle, and select the signing profile where you want it to be mirrored&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you set your bearer token and add your Twitter handle, your squeaknode will be configured to automatically make new squeaks for any new tweets that are created.&lt;/p&gt;

For a brief moment, no one knew what would happen in digital marketing, but by the 90’s it all became clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://source.unsplash.com/random/1500x1146&quot; alt=&quot;Man&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history of marketing is to a large extent a product of Internet’s history as markets have adapted to keep abreast of changes and keep up with the way the major Search Engines rank web pages. Major changes include, in chronological order:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1991- Gopher: A network protocol, one of the very first query and search tools. Gopher was widely used for a couple of years, but usage has now fallen off, with barely 100 Gopher servers now indexed. 2. 1994- Launch of Yahoo, which was formerly known as “Jerry´s Guide to the World Wide Web” after one of its founders, Jerry Yang. Yahoo received in its first year over 1 million hits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;academic-studies&quot;&gt;Academic studies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study of the history of marketing as an academic field emerged only recently. Controversies and disputes abound in the field. The publication in 1976 of the book The History of Marketing Thought, by Robert Bartels marks a turning-point in marketing thought. Since then, academics specializing in marketing decided to imitate economics, distinguishing theory and practice. Two different fields of study emerged:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the history of marketing thought, giving theoretical accounts
marketing history, focusing on the history of marketing practice
This division parallels the distinction between the history of economic thought and economic history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://source.unsplash.com/random/1500x1147&quot; alt=&quot;Thai&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practitioners of the history of marketing thought note that both practitioners and academics know relatively little about the field.[citation needed] But history has significance for academics because it helps to define the baselines upon which they can recognize change and evolve marketing theory.On the other hand, proponents of marketing history argue that one cannot fully compare the marketing field with economics and hence suggest the impracticality of divorcing theory and practice. First, marketing scholars seldom engage in the practice of marketing as much as economists engage in the development and execution of public policies. Second, business people innovate in the marketing field, and the history of marketing will remain incomplete if one dissociates academia from practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://source.unsplash.com/random/1500x1148&quot; alt=&quot;lavender flowers&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following sections discuss both approaches to the history of marketing, closing with a debate about the standard chronology of marketing, a widely known hypothesis about the history of marketing, but one that historians in the marketing field have challenged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-you-improve-sales-effectiveness&quot;&gt;How do you improve sales effectiveness?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improving sales effectiveness is not just a sales function issue; it’s a company issue, as it requires deep collaboration between sales and marketing to understand what’s working and not working, and continuous improvement of the knowledge, messages, skills, and strategies that sales people apply as they work sales opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sales effectiveness has historically been used to describe a category of technologies and consulting services aimed at helping companies improve their sales results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many companies are creating sales effectiveness functions and have even given people titles such as VP of Sales Effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://source.unsplash.com/random/1500x1147&quot; alt=&quot;Coins&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“By analyzing sales force performance, managers can make changes to optimize sales going forward. Toward that end, there are many ways to gauge the performance of individual salespeople and of the sales force as a whole, in addition to total annual sales.” In a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers, 54 percent responded that they found the “sales force effectiveness” metric very useful.&lt;/p&gt;

While it usually involves marketing more profitable services or products, it can be simply exposing the customer to other options that were perhaps not considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, large businesses usually combine upselling and cross-selling to maximize profit. In doing so, an organization must ensure that its relationship with the client is not disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://source.unsplash.com/random/1500x1146&quot; alt=&quot;Fair&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In restaurants and other similar settings, upselling is commonplace and an accepted form of business. In other businesses (e.g. car sales), the customer’s perception of the attempted upsell can be viewed negatively and impact the desired result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-should-you-upsell&quot;&gt;Why should you upsell?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upselling is a common practice for service providers that offer different service classes such as airlines (cf. Bohutinsky, 1990). According to “the journal of business and industrial marketing; written collaboratively by Michael J, Sheehan and Paul R, Prabhaker “It is five times more expensive to get a new customer as it is to hold onto a current one.” Selling to a new customer would mean having to start the sales process from the very beginning thus having to establish a new relationship with a different customer. This can be time consuming and often not very effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://source.unsplash.com/random/1500x1147&quot; alt=&quot;Gleise&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-benefits&quot;&gt;The benefits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upselling to a customer that you have already built a rapport with, means that they are more likely to buy from you, listen to your suggestions and opinions and trust you. Selling to the same customer can lead to loyal customers and repeat sales. Upselling brings up the profit that the business makes and the value of the sale. However it is important to understand that although your main objective is to bring up revenue and increase the amount of the sale, a customers experience and their time with you influences future decisions that they make. An upsell can be beneficial to both the seller and the consumer if relevant products are being shown to the customer. For instance, if you had a strict budget of $20,000 for a car, you would not want to be sold a car for twice the amount.&lt;/p&gt;

Peddling is the oldest form of direct selling. Modern direct selling includes sales made through the party plan, one-on-one demonstrations, and other personal contact arrangements as well as internet sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://source.unsplash.com/random/1500x1145&quot; alt=&quot;Checkmate&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;textbook-definition&quot;&gt;Textbook definition&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A textbook definition is: “The direct personal presentation, demonstration, and sale of products and services to consumers, usually in their homes or at their jobs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-effective-is-direct-selling&quot;&gt;How effective is direct selling?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry representative, the World Federation of Direct Selling Associations (WFDSA), reports that its 59 regional member associations accounted for more than US$183 billion in retail sales in 2014, through the activities of more than 62 million independent sales representatives. The United States Direct Selling Association (DSA) reported that in 2000, 55% of adult Americans had at some time purchased goods or services from a direct selling representative and 20% reported that they were currently(6%) or had been in the past(14%) a direct selling representative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://source.unsplash.com/random/1500x1146&quot; alt=&quot;Office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the WFDSA, consumers benefit from direct selling because of the convenience and service it provides, including personal demonstration and explanation of products, home delivery, and generous satisfaction guarantees. In contrast to franchising, the cost for an individual to start an independent direct selling business is typically very low with little or no required inventory or other cash commitments to begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most direct selling associations around the world require their members to abide by a code of conduct towards a fair partnership both with customers and salesmen…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most national direct selling associations are represented in the World Federation of Direct Selling Associations (WFDSA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hows-it-different-to-marketing&quot;&gt;How’s it different to marketing?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Direct selling is distinct from direct marketing because it is about individual sales agents reaching and dealing directly with clients. Direct marketing is about business organizations seeking a relationship with their customers without going through an agent/consultant or retail outlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Direct selling consists of two main business models: single-level marketing, in which a direct seller makes money by buying products from a parent organization and selling them directly to customers, and multi-level marketing (also known as network marketing or person-to-person marketing), in which the direct seller makes money from both direct sales to customers and by sponsoring new direct sellers and earning a commission from their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
